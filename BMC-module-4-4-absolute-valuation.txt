BMC Module 4.4: Absolute Valuation


Good financial models balance simplicity with insight.


The number of shares of a company is typically decided by a company's treasurer. 
Size of a company = market capitalization = # of shares * price of each share
% changes in share prices are meaningful - dollar amounts for share prices are not meaningful. 

Stock Splits
	Bloomberg: NI SPLREV [Reverse Stock Splits News]

Stock Buybacks
	Buying back stock shows a company has faith in itself.



Absolute Valuation
	Estimation of future earnings and their present value
		Pros: precise, anchored to earnings, disciplined thought process [?]
		Cons: demands clairvoyancce, laborious, prone to subtle manipulation

	Note that free cash flows [instead of earnings] are used when conducting absolute valuation

	Steps:
		1. Estimate long-term future cash flows
		2. Estimate WACC [weighted average cost of capital], the rate at which to discount
			Typically firms are financed by both shareholders and bondholders.
			Therefore the WACC used for the overall firm should be a blend based on this split between equity and debt financing.
				Bloomberg: WACC
					commonly ~8%
					note that for all companies, WACC > nominal GDP growth in the long run
			CAPM [!] to estimate the cost of equity
				- start with 10-year govt bond yield [risk-free rate]
					[why not 5-yr? why not 30-yr? why not 1-yr?]
				- identify historic market return for that country
				- calculate the market risk premium [market return - risk free rate]
				- estimate beta for the company [Bloomberg: BETA]
					Beta is the slope of the best fit line in the linear regression between that company's stock and SPX
						if it's a different country, use a different index for regression
					it is a measurement of the stock's sensitivity to changes in the overall market
				- multiply this beta by the market risk premium
				- add back the risk free rate to this result
				- this will be the cost of equity for that company
		3. Discount outputs from 1 by the WACC from 2
		4. Deduct the firm's indebtness, add the firm's cash, to derive the market cap
			Bloomberg: EV [Enterprise Value]
				The enterprise value belongs to both bondholders and shareholders.
				We need to subtract the total debt.
				We also need to add in cash[&equivalents] which belong to the shareholders.
				The result shouild be the market capitalization of the company. 
		5. Divide by # of shares to arrive at the estimated fair share price	


Analysts need to be aware of the earnings cycle and the interest rate cycle to form a view on the stock market.
Heavily indebted companies have more volatile share prices than companies with less/no debt.
	This is because the amount owed back to bondholders is fixed, whereas the amount owed to shareholders moves sharply.
	Debt magnifies the returns on offer to shareholders, because bondholders do not benefit from the whole firm becoming more valuable.
	Debt also magnifies the losses to shareholders, for the same reason. 
	This is one major reason why equities are more voltatile than bonds.

Sensitivities to be mindful of during valuation:
	TOP : news
	FXC : FX markets
	GLCO: commodity markets
	WEI : overall moves in stock markets [affects WACC]
	WB  : bond yield changes [affects WACC]
	positive feedback [rising share price -> company will find it easier to raise additional capital]

Relative Valuation
	Comparison with other companies and the overall market
		Pros: easier to understand, simple to calculate, does not demand long-term forecasts
		Cons: directional, hard to find truly comparable companies, presupposes fair valuation of other companies
