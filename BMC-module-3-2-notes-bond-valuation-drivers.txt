BMC Module 3.2: Bond Valuation Drivers


Yields facilitate bond valuation. 

Bond yield is the equivalent interest rate that would provide identical return at the end of the term [maturity date].

Bloomberg: YAS [Yield and Spread]
	Example: Rwandan bonds 2013-2023

Bloomberg: WB [World Bond Market]
	Lists yields for government bonds aka sovereign debt

Bond Valuation Drivers:

	Credit Risk:

		- Debt/GDP
			Government borrowing for projects
			Project spending contributes to gdp growth, but debt repayments do not contribute to gdp growth
			Higher debt as a proportion of gdp will usually mean higher debt repayment and a greater drag on gdp growth

			Example: Greek bonds in 2010 had yields peaking at 35% that year. Greek debt as a % of gdp peaked at 160%.
			Example: Why were Japanese bond yields near 0% in 2017 despite an extremely high debt/gdp ratio? [TODO]

		- Deficit/GDP [annual budget deficit divided by gdp]
			Bloomberg: WCDM [debt monitor]
			
			The higher the deficit as a % of GDP, the higher the yield [typically].
			Example: The greek deficit reached 16% of GDP in 2009, and by 2010-11 the yields for Greek bonds were 30-35%
			
		- Repayment schedule
			Short term typically has lower yield
			Long term typically has higher yield
			
			Bloomberg: DDIS shows repayment schedule for govt bonds

			Long term bonds are typically only an option for credit-worthy countries.

		- Credit ratings: AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, etc. 
			Moody's
			S&P
			Fitch

			Bloomberg: CSDR [Sovereign Ratings]

			Credit ratings have historically been less reliable for corporate bonds than for govt bonds.
				Example: Enron 2001 - largest corporate bankruptcy in the US at the time

		- Credit default swaps
			A form of insurance against govts and corporations defaulting.
			Can be a more timely warning for default than ratings agencies.

			Bloomberg: SOVR [Sovereign CDS Monitor]
			
			

	Macroeconomic Factors:

		- Short-term interest rates
			In theory, bonds with the same risk profile should have the same yield. 
			Yields and bond prices are negatively correlated.
			How are short-term interest rates related to bond yields? [TODO]
			
		- Inflation
			There is generally a positive correlation between inflation in a country and yields on its govt bonds.
			Bond yields are "nominal" [not "real"] as they do not adjust for inflation. 

			Inflation is detrimental to lenders and beneficial to borrowers.
			Deflation is beneficial to lenders and detrimental to borrowers. 
			
			Governments, almost all of whom are borrowers, tend not to mind some inflation.

			Analogy: Books are to bonds as Amazon is to the Fed

	The UK makes use of long-term govt financing. A significant portion of its debt is due after 2049.
	The US makes use of short-term govt financing. A significant portion of its debt is due within the next 5 years.

	From the perspective of govts, short-term borrowing is cheaper but riskier for borrowers than long-term borrowing.
		This is because it relies on the the ongoing appetite of lenders. 

	Yields on other bonds tend to move with yields on US govt bonds, because they serve as benchmarks for all investments.


-------------


Riskier bonds [in which borrowers have lower credit worthiness] will have significantly higher yields. 

Bond yields can be considered a running verdict on governments' handling of their economies.
