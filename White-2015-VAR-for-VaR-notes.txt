MVQM (Multivariate Quantile Model)



Multivariate quantile regression with:
	I. 	multiple random variables
	II.	multiple confidence levels
	III. 	multiple lags of the associated quantities


Quantile regression:
	- OLS regression estimates the conditional **mean** of the response variable across values of the predictor variables
	- Quantile regression estimates the conditional **median** of the response variable across values of the predictor variables
		[The median is the specific case of 0.50th quantile, or 50th percentile. The general model accomodates other quantiles] 
	
	- Seminal paper is Koenker and Bassett 1978 [this is the basis for most quantile regressions]
		Since this paper, quantile regressions have been widely used in finance, labor economics, and macroeconomics

	- White et al. generalizes this to a multivariate quantile regression



In conditions I-III above (conditions under which OLS and standard quantile regression fail), the multivariable quantile model is useful:
	White+kim+manganelli 2015, titled VAR for VaR
		[VAR = vector autoregressive]
		[VaR = values at risk]
		White et al.'s original analysis was for spillovers in VaR between a market index and financial institutions
