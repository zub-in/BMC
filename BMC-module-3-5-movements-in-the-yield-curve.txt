BMC Module 3.5: Movements in the Yield Curve


Bloomberg: FDIR Index
	Fed sets overnight interest rates [yield on a bond with 24-hr maturity]
	These correspond to the leftmost section of the yield curve.

Long-term yields are more complicated, driven by beliefs in long-term economic prospects.
	Inflation expectations are a major driver of long-term yields.


WIRP helps with predicting short-term yields
ILBE helps with predicting long-term yields

-------


If rates are low and inflation goes up, the yield curve should be steep.

If FI investors expect inflation to go up, they would sell bonds.
If FI investors expect inflation to decrease, they would buy bonds.
If FI investors expect rate increases, they would sell bonds.
IF FI investors rate cuts, they would buy bonds.

Negative slope yield curves are called 'inverted'.
	This typically means expectations of economic slowdown.
	It has historically been a predictor of recessions.
	Inversion should reflect expectations of lower inflation in the long term.


A very steep yield curve is a sign of an accelerating economy.

---------------


1. Increased govt spending + borrowing has driven growth of the fixed income market
2. Bond yields (and inversely prices) are driven by creditworthiness, inflation, and interest rates
3. Central banks have a mandate to guard against deflation and inflation [target inflation 2%]
4. Central banks influence govts, businesses, and consumers via short-term interest rates and the yield curve
5. Changes of the shape of the yield curve are strong economic indicators [e.g. inversion predicting recessions]
