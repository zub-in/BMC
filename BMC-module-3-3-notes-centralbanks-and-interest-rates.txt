For most developed economies, the inflation target is 2%.

	There have been ~56 instances of runaway inflation.
	Many of these involve govts printing large amounts of money during wartime.
		e.g. 	Germany after WW1 24000% inflation
			Zimbabwe - peaked in Nov 2008 at 8.97 * 10^22 % inflation
	
	Oil shocks 1973 and 1979 caused oil prices to spike.
	In general, inflation was a prominent issue in the 1970s.


Bloomberg: GEW [global inflation]

	There are multiple feedback loops, both for inflation and deflation.

	Inflation measures:
		- GDP deflator [from the quarterly GDP report]
		- CPI [reported monthly but less accurate than GDP deflator]
		- Core personal consumer expenditure
			Core inflation removes food and energy.

		These datasets are historic, so we also need forecasting methods.

	The Output Gap:
		The difference between the economy's potential output [?] and its actual output
