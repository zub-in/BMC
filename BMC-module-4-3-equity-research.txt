BMC Module 4.3: Equity Research

What do shareholders own?
	1. They own the earnings that a company generates after paying off all other expenses.
	2. They own the sum total of company assets that are not owed to lenders [net assets].

Earnings are a stream of future cash flows.
FI repayments are fixed, whereas equity earnings are not.
Changes in company revenues and costs make residual earnings volatile.
	e.g. FORD 1988-2022
		income statement
			top line: revenues
			bottom line: earnings [ = net income ] = revenues - costs

Bloomberg: EVTS
	Companies typically have quarterly earnings reports. Publicly traded companies are required to do so. 
	These have scheduled release dates, similar to the release of economic indicators.


How to estimate future company earnings:

	1. Industry classification
		Bloomberg: DES [security description]
		Bloomberg: CCB [company classification browser]
		Bloomberg: ICS
	
	2. Suppliers and buyers
		Costs can be better estimated using information on suppliers
		Revenues can be better estimated using information on buyers
		Bloomberg: SPLC [Supply Chain Analysis]
			e.g. Boeing: 364 suppliers, 327 customers, 10 competitors. All listeed on SPLC
			40% of Boeing revenue comes from govt contracts -> news on US defense budget is relevant to boeing investors

		OpEx vs CapEx
			Operating expenses are shorter-term expenses for day-to-day operations
			Capital expenditures are payments recorded on a balance sheet rather than expensed on the income statement [?]
			An item must be expensed on the income statement (rather than capitalized) if it has a useful life < 1 year.
				e.g. purchases of land, vehicles, buildings, or heavy machinery are CapEx
	
	3. Revenue Projections
		Industry insights are needed.
		"How big is the pie? How big is this company's slice of the pie?"
		EPS = Earnings per Share
			-> EPS forecasting provides insight into how a company's earnings are expected to grow/decline
	
	4. Cost Base
		BI [Bloomberg Intelligence]
		e.g. rare earth metal used in wind turbinesf
		e.g. Rolls-Royce in aircraft engine industry
	
		EVTS [ company events database ]
			earnings calls
			management Q&A with analysts

		DRIV [ drivers ]
		FTW [ factors to watch ]
		
	The % difference in a statistic compared with the mean analyst expectation is called the surprise (%).
		Bloomberg: SURP
	Positive surprises are called "beats" and negative ones are called "misses". 
		Surprise indices are not sufficient for valuation purposes [the correlation is not strong].
