GDP (gross domestic product) is the customary way to measure the size and performance of any economy.

Three main topics:
	- The importance of GDP to investors
	- How investors observe [measure?] GDP growth
	- How investors forecast GDP

	- How investors use economic indicators to gauge the health of the economy
	- The qualities of good economic indicators
	- About 5 of the most important economic indicators in the US

	- The regimen upon which economic indicators are published and analyzed
	- How these can be used to spot inflection points


The US has been the world's largest economy continuously since it surpassed the UK in 1872.

Economic health is best gauged through the lens of economic indicators.

The main unit of economic statistics is the nation state.

The 1920s saw spectacular policy failures [like what?],
which in part led to the Great Depression 1929->1930s

GDP calculation, in many instances, is still a work in progress. 
	- e.g. in 1987 Italy decided to include the black market in its GDP calculation,
		which caused a 17% increase in Italian GDP overnight
	- Nigerian GDP was revised upward by 89% between its 2013 estimate and its 2014 estimate,
		due to more accurate measurements of booming new industries e.g. "Nollywood"
	- In 2013, tech spending was broken out of US GDP [in what way???]

Core inflation [without food + energy] vs headline inflation [with food + energy]

There are many economic statistics for the world's largest economies.

The prevalence of these statistics can indicate properties of those economies
	- e.g. There are many pages on inflation in Brazil, as a remnant of a time of high inflation
	- Hyperinflation is defined as a period in which inflation exceeds 50% per month
	- Brazil January-March 1990: 71%, 71%, 81%

Personal consumption [consumer spending] contributes over two thirds of the US GDP

Analyzing trends in consumer spending and macroeconomic influences is vital to an investor

When analyzing a security with heavy exposure to a certain country,
	it is helpful to use that country's data as an input to the investment process [??]

	e.g. Chocolate company will likely sell more chocolate when the relevant economy is growing faster

Core economic indicators:
	- Economic growth
	- Inflation
	- Unemployment
	- Business confidence
	- Housing

1. Economic growth:

	Gross domestic product [of a country]:

		The market value of all final goods and services produced in a country.

		GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
		where	C = personal consumption
			I = private investment
			G = government consumption
			X = exports
			M = imports
			X - M = net exports

Nominal GDP growth rate does not adjust for inflation.
Real GDP growth rate does adjust for inflation.
	For example, in 1975 in the UK economy had a nominal GDP growth rate of 24%,
	but also inflation of 24%, which put the real growth rate at 0

A recession is defined as two successive quarters of negative real GDP growth.

2. Inflation

	Fixed income investors watch like hawks for inflation, because it erodes the value of bonds.

	Inflation is the "general increase in prices of goods and services,
		which diminishes the purchasing power of money."


	Primary Sources of Inflation Data:
		2.1:	[Monthly]
			PCE [Personal Consumption Expeditures] Report
				by the Bureau of Economic Analysis [BEA, part of the Department of Commerce]
			
			contains a measure of price changes in consumer goods and services
			also shows what consumers are spending their income on

		2.2:	[Monthly]
			CPI [Consumer Price Index]
				by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS, part of the Department of Labor]

			based on a representative basket of goods and services
			CPI should be truly representative of spending habits in that country

				[Note that what may be representative changes with the times]

3. Unemployment

	Consumer spending is driven by salaries, so the economy tends to shrink when unemployment is high.
	
	An overall increase in unemployment depresses GDP growth.

	[This causality should run both ways?]

----

4. Business Confidence

	Institute for Supply Management
		Purchasing Managers' Index [PMI]
			This is the most widely followed index of US manufacturing activity.
			Based on regular surveys of purchasing managers for corporations, about business conditions.
			A reading above 50 signifies optimism, whereas below 50 signifies pessimism.

		
			
------

5. Housing

	House-building accounts for only 3% of the US economy, but is nonetheless considered a strong indicator.
		1. Homebuilders need to believe that consumers are confident enough to assume a 30-year mortgage.
		2. Buying a house leads to far more purchases.

	"Housing starts" are the measure [???]


-----------------

Summary:

	Real GDP growth is the main gauge of economic health.
	Economic growth is cyclical, with booms and busts.
	Investors interpret the economy through economic indicators.
	Leading indicators attract the most investor interest.
