BMC 2.3: Currency Regulation and Control

Two types: 
	individual behavior+ethics regulations,
	government/centralbank regulation
		e.g. fixed/pegged currencies, cryptocurrency regulation


An "open economy" has more imports and exports,
	but has higher risk of disruption due to currency fluctuations

Net exporters have an incentive to weaken their currency
Net importers have an incentive to strengthen their currency

Bloomber Terminal -> ECTR [ can see which countries are major trading parters over time ]


Budget deficit: spend > receive
Budget surprlus: spend < receive

If a country wants to run a budget deficit and finance this by borrowing from international investors
	by issuing bonds in its own currency, then weakness in this country's own currency
	may deter investors from buying more bonds as they would face a loss on these assets

If a govt instead issues bonds in foreign currencies, then weakness in its own currency
	can dramatically increase the cost of repaying their debt in the foreign currency


In most cases, governments aim to manage the overall trend and volatility in their currency's value


A government may want to weaken its currency to increase the cost of imports and protect domestic industries.


------------

Central banks may intervene to maintain specific exchange rate policies:
	- Bank of England 1992
	- Swiss National Bank 2015

Successful intervention [example hong kong] and failed intervention [example argentina]



China may be manipulating their currency to maintain competitiveness of chinese exports


Bloomberg: -> NI CEN -> news topics: central banks

-------------

Main methods for a central bank to control the FX market:

	1. Direct intervention
		a central bank buys (or sells) its own currency in order to raise (or lower) its value
			-> when it buys its own currency, it sells some of its reserves (held in foreign currencies)
			-> Bloomberg: BI CURRG -> FX Macro -> Reserves/Import Cover 
				[countries are ranked by the size of their reserves in USD over time]

	2. Verbal intervention
		a warning by a central bank to market participants that it might intervene directly
			-> may be sufficient if the "threat" of direct intervention is credible

	3. Interest rate intervention
		central banks can adjust their official short-term interest rates as a means of currency intervention
			-> most commonly, tightening monetary policy (raising interest rates) prevents currency weakness
			


Whether these interventions are credible depends on a few questions:
	Does the central bank have sufficient foreign exchange reserves to continue buying its own currency?
	Has the central bank previously been successful or not when carrying out such interventions?
	Would a change in interest rates conflict with the country's underlying economic position/policy?\

		Could this also raise doubts about the political will/ability to sacrifice short-term economic 
		benefits for the sake of establishing credibility and stability in foreign exchange policy? [??]

	Lack of credibility in a central bank's intervention can make matters worse.



---------------------

1979 ERM [European Exchange Rate Mechanism] (part of EMS [European Monetary System])
1990 UK joins ERM
1999 introduction of Euro and ERM II (European Exchange Rate Mechanism II)
2011-2012 Eurozone Sofvereign Debt Crisis
	Investors sold the bonds of govts with large fiscal deficits [?]
		e.g. Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain
	This extended to flight out of Euro and into Swiss Franc




Four examples of Central Bank Interventions:

1. Bank of England 1992
	UK needed strength in Sterling vs DM to maintain membership in ERM
	UK had economic recession -> for this they needed to maintain low interest rate, 
		and weakness in Sterling, in order to sustain exports

	George Soros expected that the economic necessity would win out
	This reflected a general lack of credibility for the Bank of England's ability to maintain the value of GBP

	UK raised interest rates [peaked at 15% on Sept 16 1992], but had to leave the ERM


	Bloomberg -> GBPDEM CURNCY GPC [Candle Chart] -> change dates to 06/01/1992-01/01/1993

	This was a good example of a failed central bank intervention.

2. Swiss National Bank 2015
	In 2012 the Swiss National Bank announced that it would prevent extended Franc strength by imposing a floor at 1.200
		[vs. DM]
	This was successful as investors had strong confidence in the Swiss National Bank
	
	On Jan 15th 2015 the SNB suddenly announced it would no longer impose this floor
		There was a dramatic and abrupt reaction
		WIthin minutes, EUR/CHF fell to 0.85 within minutes

	The SNB was widely criticized for not providing any warning to investors

	Bloomberg -> EURCHF CURNCY GPC W -> change dates to01/01/2010-01/01/2016


3. Hong Kong Monetary Authority 1997-1998
	Established in 1983
	HKMA has substantial foreign currency reserves
	These reserves help to maintain credibility that pegged HKD/USD 7.80 will be maintained
	1997 Asian Financial Crisis

	HKMA threatened penalty charges on institutions which borrowed HKD to lend on to speculators wishing to sell
	This allowed the 7.80 HKD/USD peg to be maintained

	Similar episode occurred in 1998, this time bolder strategy:
		HKMA bought HKD, spent 15bn USD on buying Hong Kong equities

	This allowed the HKMA to:
		- maintain the pegged exchange rate
		- generate profits on intervention purchases
		- reinforce their credibility
	
	The current range is 7.75 - 7.85, which it still maintains

	The 7.80 peg was maintained both in 1997 and 1998
	This can't be seen on charts of spot fx prices, but evident in HKD interest rates
	
	Bloomberg -> HKD12M CURNCY GPO M -> set dates to include 1997 and 1998



4. Argentina 2001-2002
	Since 1980, Argentina has defaulted on its foreign currency debt five times
	Argentina is currently the largest single debtor of the IMF
		IMF = main international lender
	Inflation was 3000-5000% in 1989 and remains volatile.
	Official methods to measure inflation have changed over the years:
		Bloomberg -> ECST [World Economic Statistics] -> Type Argentina ->
			-> Prices+ConsumerPrices -> Transformation:YoY% -> Chart:ARNCYINX -> Maximize chart

	1991: Convertibility Plan to counter hyperinflation + liberalize foreign trade + increase productivity/growth
		- USD/ARS PEG at 1.00, maintained by foreign currency inflows by state borrowing, and by privatizing state-owned companies
		- Peg introduced by law, making subsequent changes more difficult
		- This was generally successful until 1998
			[1997 Asian Currency Crisis]
			[1998 Russia's default on debt]
			[1999 BRL devaluation by 35% -> makes argentine agricultural exports uncompetitive]
			[1999 Global agricultural prices fall]
			[general USD strengthening, which means the peg makes argentine 
			- no "lender of last resort" [?]
			- bank run 2001, argentina freezes bank accounts, IMF withdraws support
		- 2001: Dec 26th, 93 billion default = world's biggest ever bond default
		- 2002: peg changed from 1.00 to 1.40
