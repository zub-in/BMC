At the end of 2016, there were ~101 trillion USD in traded bonds in existence globally.
This exceeded the world GDP [~79 trillion], and the total value of global stock markets [~65 trillion].

Bloomberg: FIXED INCOME SRCH
	

------

US Treasury [US Govt Debt], as of end of 2016:
	1086 actively traded bonds -> 14 trillion USD

US Govt Bond Market [14 trillion USD]
US Corporate Bond Market [8 trillion USD from ~33 thousand bonds]

Overall, the US hosts about a fifth of the global bond market.
This is one of the reasons for the centricity of USD in the currency market.

The modern bond market began after the second world war, 
	after interest liberalization and the removal of capital controls [making it easier for govts to borrow]



The government bond market is also known as the "sovereign debt market". 
This is the biggest segment of the global bond market.

Bloomberg commands: 
	TREASURY SECURITIES
	SOVEREIGN DEBT OWNERSHIP [ DEBT <GO> ]
	
As of the end of 2016, Japan and China owned about 1 trillion each of US Govt Debt


Other countries can choose to sell their own currency to buy US Govt Bonds in order to weaken their own currency.
	This has the benefit of making their exports more competitive.

US Govt Bonds are widely viewed as the safest financial asset. 
US Govt Bonds are the most liquid tradable asset [?].
US Govt Bonds can be used as FX reserves.

-----------

The VIX Index is a volatility index, commonly accepted indicator of market turmoil.
	VIX high -> investors are scared, typically will buy more US Govt Bonds

Example: IBM
	Bloomberg -> IBM -> Select Security -> CAST: shows Capital Structure [parent companies + all subsidiaries, how their financing breaks down]
	Corporations typically have a tax incentive to issue corporate bonds [?].
	
-------------

Bonds have coupons [regular, fixed smaller payments] and principal [the main amount, larger]
	Bloomberg: DDIS function [debt distribution]

Bonds are long-term loans that promise regular smaller payments [coupons] and a large repayment of the principal at the end of the loan. 

----------

The remaining repayments [coupon], together with the floating price of the bond, are used to calculate the bond 'yield'. 

Generally, bond prices and yield have an inverse relationship.
	This is most clearly seen with a "perpetual bond" [coupons only, principal never repaid]
		In this case, the bond price and yield are directly inversely correlated


When yields are high	: 	new lenders are happy, and new borrowers are not
When yields are low	: 	new borrowers are happy, and new lenders are not
