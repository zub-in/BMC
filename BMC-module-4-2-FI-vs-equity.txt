BMC Module 4.2: Differences Between Equities and Bonds

Bonds have fixed repayments.

Equities have residual cash flows (dividends).
	Only after all other claims are satisfied:
		Payments to suppliers
		Compensation to employees
		Repayments to lenders
		Taxes to govt
	All of these have higher priority than dividends

Fixed costs of necessities magnify the impact of salary changes on discretionary income.
Shareholder dividends are analogous to this 'discretionary income'.

Companies that have borrowed heavily are considered riskier.

Interest cover ratio = operating income / interest expense
	measures how well a borrower can cover interest payments with their operating income


Bonds are typically preferred by risk-averse people
Equities are typically preferred by those with a higher risk appetite
